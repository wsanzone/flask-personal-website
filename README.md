Please see the requirements.txt file for packages that were used for this project.

## Project Description
This is a personal website that I built following the Corey Schafer tutorials on youtube (link can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo)
At this time, the project is fairly basic. Some static HTML files are served showing the following things. Future modifications will be made when I have time.

#### Home Page
Basic description of the website and what the links do

#### About Me
Some photos and text of things I like to do outside of work

#### My Resume
Static page showcasing my resume and projects

#### Projects
Links to different projects that I have done

#### Contact Me
This is the only dynamic page on the whole website. Includes full form validation and sends the messages to a PostgreSQL database.


To start the app, in a terminal with the folder open type python run.py to start the project.
